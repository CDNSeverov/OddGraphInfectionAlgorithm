# OddGraphInfectionAlgorithm
Algorithm for Project for Graph Theory Course at UP FAMNIT. Done in collaboration with Simona Cholakova and Matej Kunovski.

# Problem Definition
The problem revolves around minimum of initial infected verticies. A vertice becomes infected if and only if it is connected to two vertices that are infected. 
The minimum of initial vertices is the number of vertices that we need to infect at the beginning such that the whole graph is infected.

# Odd Graphs
This problem to us was given for the family of Odd Graphs.
